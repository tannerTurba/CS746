\section{AAT mode requirements}

The AAT code states

\begin{itemize}
\item[A] Pace the Atria.
\item[A] Sensing the Atria chamber.
\item[T] With triggered response to sensing. A sense in the Atria triggers an immediate pace in it. 
\end{itemize}

\noindent meaning the pacemaker must pace the atria chamber regarding the valid sensed data from the atria and the programmable parameters.


\paragraph{Programmable parameter requirements}

\begin{itemize}
\item LRL\ref{sym:LRL} shall be 60 ppm
\item URL\ref{sym:URL} shall be 120 ppm
\item ARP\ref{sym:ARP} shall be 250 ms
\item PVARP\ref{sym:PVARP} shall be 250 ms
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Purpose and abstraction level}

The purpose is to model and validate the requirements of the Pacemaker AAT mode.

\begin{itemize}
\item Atrial Amplitude, Atrial Pulse With and Sensivity are discarded because they are not relevant for the propose.
\item In this mode the chamber is always the atria so the other chambers are discarded in the model.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{VDM-SL module}

 The model of the requirements start by defining the input of the system as a sequence of senses in a chamber at a given time.

 The model of the requirements start by defining the value of the LRL.


\begin{vdm_al}
module PacemakerAAT

definitions 

values 
LRL     : nat = 60;
ARP     : nat = 250;
\end{vdm_al}

The input is a sequence and of sensed stimuli and the time of it.

\begin{vdm_al}
types 
SenseTimeline = seq of Sense ;

Sense = <NONE> | <PULSE>;

Time = nat1;
\end{vdm_al}

The output will be a sequence of the reactions to the input that can be either do nothing or discharge a pulse on the Atria at a particular time.

\begin{vdm_al}
ReactionTimeline = seq of Reaction;

Reaction = <NONE> | <PULSE>;
   
functions
\end{vdm_al}

The pacemaker its modelled as an implicit function stating that the bpm rate is larger or equal the LRL\cite{www:PacemakerCycles} and  all the valid stimuli from the input triggers an artificial pulse response. The invalid ones are filtered by the ARP interval.

\begin{vdm_al}                         
Pacemaker (inp : SenseTimeline) r : ReactionTimeline
post let m = {i | i in set inds r & r(i) = <PULSE>}
     in len r = len inp 
        and
        forall x in set m & (
           (exists y in set m & y > x) => 
                 (exists z in set m &  z >= x and z - x <= 60000/LRL)
           );


end PacemakerAAT
\end{vdm_al}

\paragraph{Requirements review}

\begin{itemize}
\item LRL \textbf{Modeled}
\item URL \textbf{Not modelled}\footnote{We discovered this requirement is contradictory and its a minor error in a table from the specification.}
\item ARP \textbf{Modeled}.
\item PVARP available to modes with atrial sensing is the time interval following a ventricular event when an atrial cardiac event shall not 
   \begin{enumerate}
   \item Inhibit an atrial pace. 
   \item Trigger a ventricular pace.
   \end{enumerate} \textbf{Not modelled}\footnote{We discovered this requirement is contradictory and its a minor error in a table from the specification.}
\end{itemize}
