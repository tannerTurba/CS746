The Pacemaker Challenge problem has been proposed by the 
North American Software Certification Consortium, based 
on a pacemaker specification offered by Boston Scientific. 
Participants in the challenge are invited to develop models, 
designs and implementations, as well as generating evidence 
that would be of value in certifying the software. More 
details can be found in:
