This is an erroneous version of the alarm example from the VDM-SL
book, John Fitzgerald and Peter Gorm Larsen, Modelling Systems --
Practical Tools and Techniques in Software Development}, Cambridge
University Press, 2nd edition 2009. This version of the example is
used for illustrating the tool support in tutorial material about
Overture. It is inspired by a subcomponent of a large alarm system
developed by IFAD A/S. It is modelling the management of alarms for an
industrial plant. The purpose of the model is to clarify the rules
governing the duty roster and calling out of experts to deal with
alarms. A comparable model of this example also exists in VDM++.
